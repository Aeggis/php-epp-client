{"name":"Php-epp-client","tagline":"Object-oriented PHP EPP Client","body":"### Welcome to the PHP EPP Client project.\r\nThis project is created to give you the best possible way to connect to a domain name registry anywhere in the world via the standard EPP protocol.\r\n\r\nLike EPP itself, the code is completely object-oriented. This means that all EPP objects (domains, hosts, contacts) are objects in the PHP code, that can be extended to match your own needs, without compromizing the base object. Extensions to the EPP protocol are created by extending the PHP objects in this code and adding functionality.\r\n\r\nAlso all commands (create, delete, info, modify) are objects in this PHP code, and can be extended when a registry decides to add or remove fields and deviate from the standard EPP implementation.\r\n\r\nLastly, all errors are returned by throwing eppException. This exception can be caught to handle any error that occurs during object handling or communication with the registry\r\n\r\n### DNSSEC compliant\r\nThe code for DNSSEC compliance is already in the base project. Actually, our own implementation already signed and maintains over 300.000 domain names using this code, so it really works!\r\n\r\n\r\n### TMCH or other additions\r\nThe code supports the sunrise, landrush and claims periods of draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase and the TMCH. Sample code is included how to check if a domain name has a claim and how to retrieve CNIS info from the TMCH. For this, a registrar account is needed with the TMCH. This account can be requested from ICANN if you are ICANN-accredited registrar.\r\n\r\n### Connecting to a registry\r\nPlease feel free to add new registry connections in the Registries section. This will enable other users to simply connect to a registry. Connection to SIDN (registry for .NL domain names) is added as a sample connection, but also connections to our own EPP service (metaregEppConnection), to DNS Belgium, EurID, Donuts, Openprovider, etc etc.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease feel free to ask for support or to contribute to this code by issueing a pull request.
